# Welcome 

This GitHub space contains many of the open-source projects that I've worked on over the years. 

## License

Unless otherwise defined within the individual repositories (projects) the default license will be the https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html

## Use and Enjoy

But remember to test and verify before using anywhere close to production. While all have been tested, and worked well, when posted that does not mean that these will work in your environment.
